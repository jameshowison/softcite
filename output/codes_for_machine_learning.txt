"bioj:a2003-44-SCIENCE","bioj:a2003-44-SCIENCE-C11-mention","The creation of new software capable of both visualizing and analyzing the genome tiling arrays was necessary since the concept of genome tiling arrays has not yet been commercialized by Affymetrix. Software capable of chip image deconvolution was developed. The ChipViewer program uses an input file of tiling chip probe information and (x,y) coordinates and multiple CELTM files (containing experimental hybridization data), and produces an output file which contains ordered data for each probe on the chip. Then it sorts the probes of each segment into the actual sequence order of the segment. As output, it generates a file (and a deconvoluted chip image) which lists the intensity values for each probe. The program displays the chip hybridization signals along with various “tracts” including the gene annotation, alongside the full-length cDNA annotation for each corresponding genome segment being interrogated on a tiling chip.
	Furthermore, intensity statistics for arbitrary features located on a chip, such as annotated genes and intergenic clusters were computed. Hybridization data were normalized by dividing each probe intensity value in a given experiment by the median intensity value of all probes in that experiment (including PM, MM, and control probes on the chip). The median intensity value of all probes were determined to be a good estimate of the background noise level in a given experiment. Initially we tested the pilot chips and visualization software by hybridizing the arrays with RNA prepared from a single gene. In vitro RNA from an RAFL cDNA clone was synthesized, labeled with biotin and hybridized to one of the four tiling arrays (Fig. S23). Analysis of the hybridization signals using all of the oligos for a particular gene or only the even or odd numbered oligos (Fig. S23), indicate that the gene structures predicted by the visualization software yields the same gene model whether all of the oligos or only the even/odd oligos are used for the prediction. These studies indicated that a genome-wide end-to-end tile of oligos will be equally effective and more space efficient than the overlapping probe design produced for the pilot tiling chips.","ChipViewer"

As both analyses resulted in identical trees, the following search strategy was chosen: stepwise addition of 100 random taxa sequences, followed by Tree Bisection-Reconnection (TBR) branch swapping (100 trees held at each step during the stepwise addition, MULTREES on, STEEPEST DESCENT on). Boot-strap analyses were conducted with the same software program, employing a full heuristic search with 500 replicates, a simple addition sequence, and TBR swap-ping (10 trees held at each step, MULTREES on, STEEPEST DESCENT on). The consensus of the bootstrap replicates was used to determine bootstrap values. The search strategy of the wood matrix was adjusted because of excessive computational time to run the analysis to completion. Therefore, MULTREES option was turned off, and a heuristic search using 1000 instead of 100 replicates was carried out. Furthermore, a topological constraint tree had to be postulated in which the ingroup was forced to be monophyletic.","PAUP*"

B2M and PPIA were identified as the most stable pairing. In order to achieve a pair-wise variation value (V) below the cut-off of 0.15 additional genes should theoretically be used; however this cut-off point is not absolute [14] and may not always be achievable [42]. No significant difference in target gene expression was observed when the top three most stable EC genes identified by geNorm were used confirming that using of a pair of genes may be more practicable given cost, work load and sample availability considerations.","geNorm"
